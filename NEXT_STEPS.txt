Secrets are being sent via url parameters. perhaps we could have an invisible field and have the bot fill that. 
Then reveal it to the user once it's been written into. Then the alarm bells go off and show the red security banner et all.
thus we would not be taking in any secrets actually to the backend.

Next we want to couch all of this in a webpage that AI will actually traffic. and I was thinking AI tools for finance are happening right now
so perhaps we fill up the site with SEO for Ai securities, pages talking about metrics and trends. try to make it high priority to a bot seeking results for new finanace info on AI stocks etc.
Point being, this page would get traffic. Not just buzzwords, but we gotta build out pages and SEO markers and make it friendly to bot search.

If we can simplify further, we could make this all work on github pages and get traffic for the demo that way.

We also want some way to read and print the demo_stats the sources, etc. (if that lasts through the simplification process.)
